title: "First Program"

The *C programming language* (or simply known as C) was developed back in
the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie. **Despite its age**, C still remains a "must
have" tool in every programmer's toolkit. Why? Well, `pretty much` every
programming language out there adopted C's style (C++, Java, JavaScript,
PHP, Python, and so on and so forth).

It is crucial to learn to think in this language. Why? Python, for example, does many things
underneath the hood, but you have to understand the process in order to call yourself a
programmer. We'll see that in future lessons :)


A simple program in C looks like this

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
   printf("Hi mom");
}
```

Some weird symbols over here. No worries, we're getting there. The only takeaway here is the printf statement. This one prints Hi mom in the console. Well, it can print anything.

```c
printf("123") // prints 123
printf("!@#$^&*()") // prints !@#$^&*()
printf("Hello, I am 35 years old") // prints Hello, I am 35 years old
```

Create a C program that prints I like pizza in the console

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

}
```
