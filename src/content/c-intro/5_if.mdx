title: "If"
---
A huge part of programming is represented by if statemets. In real life, if we feel thirsty, we drink water for instance. 
In C, programmers often refer to false conditions as 0 and true as 1. 

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){

	int thirsty = 0; // 0 means we are not thirsty
	
	if(thirsty == 0){
		printf("I am not thirsty");
	}
	
	if(thirsty == 1){
		printf("I am thirsty");
	}
}
```

Because the first condition is true (thirsty is indeed 0), I am not thirsty is printed. 
The second if condition is evaluated to false. Why? Because thirsty is 0, not 1. In this case, the message I am thirsty is not printed, because the condition is false.

So, if the contition inside the parantheses is true, we enter into if's body and do whatever instructions are over there. If the contition is not true, we skip the instructions inside that if statement.

```c
int main(){

	int thirsty = 1; // 1 means we are thirsty
	
	if(thirsty == 0){
		printf("I am not thirsty");
	}
	
	if(thirsty == 1){
		printf("I am thirsty");
	}
}
```

Now we are thirsty. thirsty = 1, so if(thirsty == 1) becomes true. I am thirsty is shown in  the console. A common mistake among new learners is the use of = where == is needed. 
The = sign (one equal) is used for assignements like int apples = 2.
The == sign (two equals) is used to compare left to right:
1 == 2 is false (0)
3 == 3 is true (any other value but zero - we tend to think of it as 1)
1 = 5 this doesn't make sense (the compiler throws an error)
