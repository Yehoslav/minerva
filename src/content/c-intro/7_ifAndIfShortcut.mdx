```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
	int thirsty = 1; // 1 means I am thirsty, 0 means I am not
	int isBottleOpen = 0; // bottle is not open
	int isWaterCold = 1; // water is cold
	int permission = 0; // teacher doesn't allow me to drink water yet

	permission = 1; // teacher gives me permission to drink
	isBottleOpen = 1; // now I can open the bottle

	if(thirsty == 1){
		if(isBottleOpen == 1){
			if(isWaterCold == 1){
				if(permission == 1){
					printf("I can drink water");
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

This is from our last lesson. Some programmers like to write this on a single line:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
	int thirsty = 1; // 1 means I am thirsty, 0 means I am not
	int isBottleOpen = 0; // bottle is not open
	int isWaterCold = 1; // water is cold
	int permission = 0; // teacher doesn't allow me to drink water yet

	permission = 1; // teacher gives me permission to drink
	isBottleOpen = 1; // now I can open the bottle

	if(thirsty == 1 && isBottleOpen == 1 && isWaterCold == 1 && permission == 1){
		printf("I can drink water");
	}
}
```

Note that:

-   3 &lt; 4 is evaluated to true (1), because 3 is indeed less than 4
-   10 &lt; 5 is evaluated to false (0)
-   6 &lt;= 6 is evaluated to true (1) because 6 is less than or equal to 6
-   7 &gt;= 7 is evaluated to true(1)

We want to make sure that our rocket can take off safely. This is done only when all the requirements are checked. 
1) if wind speed is greater than 100, it's risky, so the rocket won't take off. If wind speed is less than 100 (let's say, 80), we can go to the next step.
2) if software is not update to the latest version, the rocket won't take off
3) if we have 4 astronauts inside the ship, then we are good to go

Note: use only one if statement. Update the variables below our declarations to make the rocket take off safely
