title: 'Vars Int'
exercises:
    - condition: |
          Write a program that:
          1) has a variable called speed, of type int, that holds the value 100
          2) has a second variable called x, of type int, that holds the value -12345
          3) use a printf to show the value of speed in the console
          4) user a printf to show the value of x in the console

    - init_code: |
          #include <stdio.h> // Exposes the printf function

          int main() {
              // Your code goes here
          }

Let's say we have 2 cans of soda. How can we store this information? How to tell our computer that we have 2 cans of soda and not 10? If we buy 2 more, than we have 4 cans, right?

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){

	int cans = 2;

}
```

We just told our computer that we have 2 cans of soda. Let's break the statement into pieces.
First of all, we look at cans which is the name of the variable. Think of a variable as a container that contains an information about something. In our case, the variable called cans contains the information about how many cans we have. How many? Well, there's 2 :)
Secondly, we see an equal sign which tell the computer "Ok, cans is equal to 2", so we assign what it is on the right side of = to what it is on the left side of =.
Last to end, we have something called int. That tells the computer "cans is a variable that will eventually hold an integer value", that is 1, 4, 10, -100, 2024, 0 and so on.
Finally, at the end of each statement, we have to place a semicolon.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){

	int slicesOfPizza = 8;
	printf("%d", slicesOfPizza);

}
```

This program prints 8 in the console. We notice the %d. This acts as a placeholder.
%d is replaced by the value of slicesOfPizza. And yes, there's a comma after "%d" (we'll see later why)
