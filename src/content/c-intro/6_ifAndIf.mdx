title: 'If and If'
---

Again, if we feel thirsty, we drink water. But there are other conditions: if I am thirsty and if the bottle is open and if the water is cold and if my teacher gives me permission to drink, then I can drink water.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
	int thirsty = 1; // 1 means I am thirsty, 0 means I am not
	int isBottleOpen = 0; // bottle is not open
	int isWaterCold = 1; // water is cold
	int permission = 0; // teacher doesn't allow me to drink water yet

	permission = 1; // teacher gives me permission to drink

	if(thirsty == 1){
		if(isBottleOpen == 1){
			if(isWaterCold == 1){
				if(permission == 1){
					printf("I can drink water");
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

The program doesn't print anything. Why? Because my bottle of water is not open :) so the second if is false, because isBottleOpen = 0 (we haven't changed that). If we want to reach printf, we must go through all if statements and all be evaluated to true.

```c
#include <stio.h>
int main(){
	int thirsty = 1; // 1 means I am thirsty, 0 means I am not
	int isBottleOpen = 0; // bottle is not open
	int isWaterCold = 1; // water is cold
	int permission = 0; // teacher doesn't allow me to drink water yet

	permission = 1; // teacher gives me permission to drink
	isBottleOpen = 1; // now I can open the bottle

	if(thirsty == 1){ // if I am thirsty
		if(isBottleOpen == 1){ // and if bottle is open
			if(isWaterCold == 1){ // and if water is cold
				if(permission == 1){ // and if I have my teacher's permission
					printf("I can drink water");
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

This indeed prints I can drink water
